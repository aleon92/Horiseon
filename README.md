## Description

 This repo is to demostrate what I learned in class this week by taking a code and cleaning it up to make it easier to read for another person. I did it by changing classes to id, changing the css for said class/ids, added systematic html, and also consolidated some of the css. This made it easier to make changes if I wanted to come back to the project to improve upon it.
